üíªüõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack 

‚û£**Pivot Tables:**

Pivot tables are used to summarize and aggregate the data, especially for showing net sales per customer, region, and division over multiple years (2019‚Äì2021). These tables allow dynamic rearrangement of the data to examine it from different perspectives (e.g., by year or by customer).


‚û£**Conditional Formatting**

To visually highlight key insights, Excel's conditional formatting have been applied. This feature would color-code cells based on values (like highlighting higher growth percentages in dark blue or lower ones in light blue), making the report easier to interpret visually. In the performance section, conditional formatting is applied to emphasize sales growth or decline across different products or regions.


‚û£**Formulas and Calculations**

Formulas like SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, and VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP are used to aggregate and lookup specific data. Additionally, functions like YEAR() and IFERROR() have been used to clean and format the data.

‚û£**Slicers and Filters**

The filters visible in the report (e.g., "Region," "Customer," "Division") are powered by Excel slicers or drop-down filters. These allow the user to easily filter data dynamically without needing to rewrite queries or manually sort data.
 In the report, a user can filter net sales performance by a specific region (like the USA or India) or by division (N & S, P & A, etc.), which would then dynamically update the summary tables and charts.
 
‚û£**Power Query**

Power Query is used for data transformation and importing data from multiple sources (e.g., CSV, database exports). It allows for cleansing and reshaping data before loading it into Excel for analysis. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets like those in the sales report.

‚û£**Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)**

Although DAX is typically used in Power BI, Excel Power Pivot also supports DAX for performing more advanced calculations within pivot tables. DAX helped to calculate year-over-year changes, cumulative totals, and other metrics derived from raw sales data.The percentage growth calculations (e.g., "21 v/s 20") is an example of DAX function used .DAX functions such as CALCULATE and DIVIDE to compute and compare sales growth across multiple periods have also been implemented.
